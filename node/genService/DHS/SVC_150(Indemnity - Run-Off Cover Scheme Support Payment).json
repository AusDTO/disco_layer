    "description": "The Run-Off Cover Indemnity Scheme (ROCS) is funded on an ongoing basis through a charge on insurers called the Run-Off Cover Scheme Support Payment which is levied as a percentage of insurers' medical indemnity insurance income and is shown on doctors' premium notices. The ROCS therefore ensures that eligible doctors receive medical indemnity cover that is secure, does not require further payment and is based on the cover they had while they were working.",
