    "description": "Child Disability Assistance Payment (CDAP) is available for carers of children with a disability and is payable in addition to the payment of Carer Allowance (CA) for the child. Families caring for a child with a disability may receive an annual payment of $1000 to help them purchase assistance for their child - for example, to purchase a wheelchair, install a hoist in the family home, modify the family car, or for respite care or therapy. The payment will be made for each child who qualifies their parent/carer for payment of CA. This money can be spent however the family chooses.",
