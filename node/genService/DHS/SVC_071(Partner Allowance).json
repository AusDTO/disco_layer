    "description": "Partner Allowance (PA) is an income support payment for older people who  are partners of income support recipients and  face barriers to finding employment because of their lack of recent workforce experience. PA was introduced so that each partner of a couple receives a separate payment, rather than one of the couple receiving a combined payment. This ensures that each customer is treated as an individual rather than being dependent upon another person. There are no new grants for PA from the 20 September 2003. ",
