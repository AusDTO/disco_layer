    "description": "ABSTUDY Under 16 Boarding Supplement is to assist boarding schools that have a significant number of Indigenous enrolments with the shortfall in boarding and tuition fees paid to an eligible school for students under 16 years of age who receive a lower rate of ABSTUDY Living Allowance than those aged between 16 and 20 years. These boarding schools would then receive the same rate of assistance for all their eligible secondary school students who are entitled to Living Allowance and approved for Away from Home entitlements.",
