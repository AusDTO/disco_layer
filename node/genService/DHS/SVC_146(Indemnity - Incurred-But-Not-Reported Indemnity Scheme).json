Under the Act, medical defence organisations that existed on 30 June 2002 may participate in the IBNR scheme unless the Minister determines otherwise. To date, the Minister has determined that United Medical Protection Limited is the only medical defence organisation to actively participate in the IBNR indemnity scheme. ",
