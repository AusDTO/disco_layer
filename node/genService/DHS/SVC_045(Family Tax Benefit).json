    "description": "Family Tax Benefit (FTB) is a payment to help families with the cost of raising children. It consists of two parts: FTB Part A is a payment to help raise children and increases with the number of children in care; FTB Part B provides additional assistance to families with one main income earner. The rate depends on the age of the youngest child rather than the number of children.",
