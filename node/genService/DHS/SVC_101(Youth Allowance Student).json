    "description": "Youth Allowance Student (YFST) is an income support payment for students aged 16-24 undertaking or intending to undertake an approved course of study which aims to: ensure eligible young people receive adequate levels of income while studying or training; encourage young people to choose further education or training over job search if they do not have sufficient skills to obtain long-term employment; and encourage young people to undertake a range of activities that will promote entry into employment. Some 15 year olds may qualify for Youth Allowance (YA) and some full-time students and Australian Apprentices continue to qualify for YA after they turn 25. Assistance for students or Australian Apprentices aged 25 years or over is generally provided under Austudy. ",
