This is a one off incentive which gives participants financial assistance up to a total of $6,000 to undertake emergency medicine training.\nThe department maintains a register of eligible GPs and makes payments to GPs when theyve completed their first 10 working days of the locum commitment. Human Services also tracks the two year period for participants to undertake their locum commitment.",
